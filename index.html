    <h2 class="Brief">A Brief History</h2>
    <p class="Bp1">The history of water slides can be traced back to early water parks and theme parks in the 20th century. The first documented water slide was presented in New Zealand at the 1906 International Exhibition, featuring "chute boats" that slid into a lake. Herbert Sellner, in 1923, designed a similar ride with water toboggans in Minnesota. George Millay later popularized the concept of water parks, opening the first SeaWorld in San Diego in 1964 and the first dedicated water park, Wet \'n Wild, in Orlando in 1977<p>
